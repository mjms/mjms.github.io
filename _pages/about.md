Hi!

Most recently, I finished my PhD in Computational Neuroscience at the University of Chicago with [Dr. Nicho Hatsopoulos](https://hatsopouloslab.uchicago.edu/) where I studied the temporal dynamics of motor cortical neural networks during goal-directed behavior.

Currently, I am interested in studying dynamics of other networked systems such as urban and natural environments.

I am also a creative coder, rapid prototyper, gardener and food grower, with a pottery side-hustle.
