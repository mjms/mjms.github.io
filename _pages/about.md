Hi! I'm Marina! My research interests lie in the intersection of nature and computation. 


Most recently, I finished my PhD in Computational Neuroscience at the University of Chicago with [Dr. Nicho Hatsopoulos](https://hatsopouloslab.uchicago.edu/) where I studied the temporal dynamics of motor cortical neural networks during goal-directed behavior.

I am a generalist: a rapid prototyper, an avid gardener and food grower, with a pottery side-hustle.
