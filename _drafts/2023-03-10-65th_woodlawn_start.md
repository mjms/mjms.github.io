On April 10th 2021, my partner and I joined The 65th st and Woodlawn Ave Community Garden.

To celebrate two years of being part of this incredible place, I will be posting about some of the things we learned along the way. Follow along this month, as I talk about how to use climbing wall hardware to build a trellis, hand knitting a biodegradable mesh for pole beans, and the wonders of the stiff goldenrod!
